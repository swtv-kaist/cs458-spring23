# KAIST CS458 Dynamic Analysis of Software Source Code (Spring'23)

This class covers automated SW testing/verification techniques to detect SW bugs effectively and efficiently. In particular, this class focuses to teach techniques that automatically generate test cases to achieve high code coverage and, thus, to detect many bugs.

The class aims to teach practical applications of advanced testing/verification techniques as well as their underlying algorithms.  This class guides students to use various open-source software testing/verification tools through HWs and learn the underlying mechanisms to maximize the performance of automated testing/verification.
